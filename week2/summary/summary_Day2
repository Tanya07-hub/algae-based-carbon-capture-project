What I Did Today:

- Conducted a deep dive into phosphorus uptake by algae cells, gaining a fundamental understanding of this process.
- Learned that the P:N ratio is crucial, specifically, that a high phosphorus concentration combined with low nitrogen can decrease cell growth.
- Understood the concept of luxury uptake of phosphorus, where cells can accumulate large amounts of phosphorus when nitrogen is low in the wastewater.
- Began documenting the basic design of the bioreactor in AutoCAD, explaining the rationale behind the chosen design elements.

Challenges Faced:

- Struggled to translate initial conceptual research findings directly into precise AutoCAD drawing actions.
- Experienced some initial difficulties with achieving exact dimensions and alignments for the basic shapes in AutoCAD.

What I Found Interesting:

- The exciting potential for harvested cells, rich in accumulated phosphorus from luxury uptake, to be used as fertilizers.


For my next work session, I will focus on these core AutoCAD tasks:

- Draw the Main Panel: I will focus on accurately drawing the main flat panel of my photobioreactor in AutoCAD with its correct basic dimensions.
- Draw the Airlift Column : I will create the initial, rough drawing of my airlift column next to the main panel, establishing its basic outer dimensions.
- Document Initial Drawing: I will take a screenshot and continue documenting these initial drawing steps and the basic rationale for their shapes and placement in my notes.
