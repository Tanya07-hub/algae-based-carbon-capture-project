My Progress Summary: June 13th - June 14th, 2025

What I Did:

- Finished Main AutoCAD Design: Got the core bioreactor drawing done, including all the tricky parts like the airlift, flat panel, piping, lighting, and all the labels.
- Sorted GitHub Stuff: Organized my project notes on GitHub, updated my project status, and set up how images should be placed.
- Started Carbon Capture Course: Kicked off my Coursera course on carbon capture and took solid, cited notes.
- Figured Out Future Needs: Realized I need to think about adding sodium nitrate, controlling temperature, and managing pH in the bioreactor design later on.

What I Found Interesting:

- Carbon Overshoot: It's wild that most climate models assume we'll actually go over our carbon budget and then rely on huge amounts of CO2 removal later.
- Stubborn Emissions: Learned that emissions from things like farming are super hard to cut with just renewable energy, meaning we really need man-made ways to capture carbon.
- Specific Carbon Tech: Got into the details of BECCS and Direct Air Capture - how they work, what they cost, and their pros and cons.
- Thinking Holistically: Enjoyed the process of getting the main drawing done, then spotting all the extra control systems I'll need to make the bioreactor work in real life.

What I Found Challenging:

- AutoCAD Details: Getting all the small, intricate details in AutoCAD just right, like breaking lines and ensuring perfect connections.
- Condensing Notes: It was a bit tricky to boil down complex course info into short, clear notes for GitHub.
- Anticipating Needs: Had to really think ahead to figure out all the extra control systems the bioreactor will need, beyond just the basic structure.

What I Want to Do by the End of Week 2:

- Calculate target bioreactor volume (based on HRT, phosphorus uptake).
- Begin research on suitable bioreactor construction materials.
- Continue Coursera carbon capture course and integrate notes into GitHub.
