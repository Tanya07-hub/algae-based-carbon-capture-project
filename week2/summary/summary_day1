# Day 1 Summary: Foundational Research & Bioreactor Insights

 **What I Did Today:**
    * Conducted an in-depth analysis of one key research paper: "Growth of Chlorella vulgaris in High Concentrations of Nitrate and Nitrite for Wastewater Treatment.
    * Thoroughly extracted quantitative data and interpreted its various graphs and tables, specifically understanding *Chlorella vulgaris*'s performance with nitrate and nitrite.
    * Translated these research findings into actionable insights for the hybrid bioreactor design, considering both general applications and specifics for low-income areas with a flat panel and airlift column system.
    * Clarified the fundamental understanding of nitrate's role in water purification and its assimilation mechanism by *Chlorella vulgaris*.
    * Learned how to create and manage files on GitHub for project documentation.

 **Challenges Faced:**
    * The depth and density of the research paper meant I could only thoroughly analyze one, rather than the initial goal of two, for today.
    * Experienced minor challenges in precisely identifying specific graphs during discussion, which required clarification.

 **What I Found Interesting:**
    * The **remarkable tolerance of Chlorella vulgaris to very high concentrations of both nitrate and nitrite.
    * The **synergistic effect observed when combining nitrate and nitrite, leading to significantly higher biomass yields (up to 7.8 g/L).
    * The consistent lag phases identified in growth curves, which are crucial for Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) planning.
    * The understanding that light and COâ‚‚ become limiting factors at high nitrogen levels, reinforcing the importance of the hybrid system's design.

 **What I Will Do for Day 2:**
    * Conduct a deep analysis of the second critical research paper: "Effect of organic carbon to nitrogen ratio in wastewater on growth, nutrient uptake and lipid accumulation of a mixotrophic microalgae *Chlorella* sp."
    * Focus on understanding the crucial C:N ratio** and its impact on nitrogen removal, lipid accumulation, and overall bioreactor performance in the hybrid system.
    * Begin to research phosphorus and other essential elements, quantifying their required concentrations and exploring sustainable sourcing options.
    * Start a preliminary investigation into AutoCAD for the photobioreactor design, focusing on practical and cost-effective construction for low-income areas.
