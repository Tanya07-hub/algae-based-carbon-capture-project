Day 3-4 Log - Carbon Capture

What I Did:
- Studied three research papers on low-cost bioreactor setups and took detailed summary notes.
- Analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each design.
- Developed a hybrid bioreactor concept by combining features from two simpler designs:
  - Improved mixing limitations in the thin-film reactor using the airlift photobioreactor’s efficient circulation and gas exchange.
  - Enhanced light exposure in the airlift design using the thin-film reactor’s high surface-to-volume ratio.
- Sketched the hybrid design (3–4 iterations) to visualize and refine the concept.
- Balanced theoretical understanding with practical design thinking.

What I Found Interesting
- Blending two different bioreactor models to optimize light distribution and mixing was both creative and rewarding.
- Discovering how scalable systems can be built using simple, low-cost materials was insightful.

Challenges I Faced:
- Sketching the hybrid design took multiple tries to get the structure right.
- Some research papers were dense and required revisiting key scientific concepts.
- Applying basic laws of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics to evaluate the design proved challenging — this will be revisited later.
- The depth of research and note-taking extended over two full days.

Next Steps:
- Continue reviewing environmental and operating parameters (temperature, pH, light intensity, mixing).
- Begin creating simple diagrams of the hybrid design using AutoCAD.
