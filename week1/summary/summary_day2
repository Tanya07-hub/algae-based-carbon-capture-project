Day 2 Summary - Carbon Capture Project 

Objective of the day:
The goal was to identify which strain of algae would be suitable for the research taking in key factors such as its ability to capture Co2 and its biomass productivity.

Data Analysis:
A data set was analyzed to compare different algae species kept under various temperatures and Co2 concentration. Chlorella sp. particularly kept at 25 degrees Celcius and 15mg/Ld Co2, showed
the most promising results in terms of both biomass and Co2 capture, making it the most viable canditate in bioreactor-based application among other species tested.

Comparative reasoning and literature support:
- The research paper referenced Chlorella sp. without specifying the exact species.
- To narrow down the focus, reviewed various research papers to understand how these strains help with water purification techniques and pollutant removal in wasterwater.
- Focus was placed on 3 common strains used in bioreactors:
1) Chlorella Vulgaris 
2) Chlorella pyrenoidosa
3) Chlorella sorokiniana
- Anlayzed pollutant removal efficiencies of these strains including, dyes, bacterial pathogens and heavy metals.
- Examined optimum parameters (eg: Co2 concentration, temperature) that these strains work the best at
- This combined evaluation helped identify the best Chlorella sp. for the study's objectives incarbon capture and waste water treatment.

Final Assumption:
Chlorella vulgaris is selected as the most suitable species because its optimum growth parameters—particularly temperature and CO₂ concentration—closely align with the conditions shown in the experimental data. 
This alignment corresponds to the highest carbon capture efficiency and biomass productivity observed in the study’s results.

Refelection:
- The process highlighted the importance of consulting multiple sources rather than relying on a single source
- It involved cross-referencing data from several other papers to identify consistent patterns
- Emphasis was placed on ensuring all results and assumptions were supported by credible, cited sources.
