Day 2 Summary - Carbon Capture Project 

Objective of the day:
The goal was to identify which strain of algae would be suitable for the research taking in key factors such as its ability to capture Co2 and its biomass productivity.

Data Analysis:
A data set was analyzed to compare different algae species kept under various temperatures and Co2 concentration. Chlorella sp. particularly kept at 25 degrees Celcius and 15mg/Ld Co2, showed
the most promising results in terms of both biomass and Co2 capture, making it the most viable canditate in bioreactor-based application among other species tested.

Comparative reasoning:
