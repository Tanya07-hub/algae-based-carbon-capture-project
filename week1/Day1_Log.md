Day 1 Log - Carbon Capture Project

What I did today:
- Learned about the carbon budget through the Carbon Capture and Storage course by the University of Edinburg. Completed module 1 partially and made detailed notes on key values, sectors and climate scenarios.
- Interepreted visual graphs to understand what each show and explained how these graphs will link to my project.
- Explored how bioreactors work and their components
- Sketched a basic flat panel algae bioreactor and briefly understood how it operates

What I found Interesting:
- The idea of the carbon budget-that there is finite amount of CO2 that could be emitted to stay below the global warming treshold-was eye-opening to learn about
- Learned that photobioreactors let light in so algae can photosynthesis by capturing CO2- a concept I hadn't known before

Challenges faced:
- Felt tired by the end, so I did not write detailed notes on how bioreactors work and their important components. This is something I will revisit on day 2 to understand in more detail.
- Learning Github for the first time-took a while to figure it out but I am finally here!

What I will do for Day 2:
- Analyzing bioreactor designs by reading articles and research papers
- Materials and components used for building efficient bioreactors
- Understanding the environmental conditions and operating parameters
- Summarize notes and identify complex terms encountered in the research
