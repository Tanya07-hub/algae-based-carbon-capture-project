# algae-based-carbon-capture-project

What is this project about?

This is an independent 6 weeks summer project that explores the function of a sustainable, algae bioreactor that absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere.
Algae absorbs CO2 during photosynthesis making them strong allies to fight against climate change,
Some algae species can also help assist int he purification of wastewater by absorbing nutrients and pollutants.

Objective:
- To design a small-scale bioreactor that integrates algae cultivation for dual benefits: absorb atmospheric CO2 and for water purification.
- The system will be designed using Fusion 360 by retrieving data from scientific articles and research papers.
- The entire project is structured to simulate real research study, with clear defined deliverables and a final report and presentation.

Why did I choose to focus on this project?
- Climate change is an accelerating global crisis due to a rise in greenhouse emissions. Algae offers a renewable, biological method to capture CO2 especially in areas where industrial and mechanical cabron capture is infeasible.
- This project helps build interdisciplinary skills-combining science, sustainability, chemical engineering, biology and AutoCAD designing-which are essential in sustainbility focused careers.
-The findings are research done on this algae based bioreactors in this study, could be scaled in future academic and professional context

Rough Project Timeline:
- Week 1 : Deifine goals, understand algae bioreactors and sketch ideas
- Week 2 : Study different algae types, learn AutoCAD basics, and start CAD modeling
- Week 3 : Review design, compare with exisitng models and improve CAD design
- Week 4 : Add filternation features and explore advantages and disdvantages
- Week 5 : Optimize design, reach out to professors in  the field to get opinions, finalize CAD model with research materials
- Week 6 : Compile work, write 5-6 pages report on findings, blog my work and reflect on progress.
