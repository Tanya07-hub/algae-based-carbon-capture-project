# Green Tech for All: Affordable Algae Bioreactors Tackling CO‚ÇÇ & Clean Water in Low-Income Zones
*Bridging Science and Engineering for a Greener Future*

## üöÄ Project Overview
What if we could harness nature‚Äôs own engineers ‚Äî algae ‚Äî to fight climate change and clean our water, all through cutting-edge design and research?
This **6-week self-paced** journey combines AutoCAD modeling with scientific research. Instead of building physical hardware, I am creating a **digital prototype** inspired by current studies, carefully analyzing and refining bioreactor designs to enhance carbon capture and water purification potential.

By synthesizing scientific literature and progressively improving my CAD skills, this project aims to turn ideas into practical engineering concepts ‚Äî paving the way for future innovation.

## üåç Why it matters
 - **30+ billion tons of CO‚ÇÇ** is spewed into our atmosphere annually, fueling climate crises.
 - Millions suffer from **polluted water sources**, threatening health and livelihoods.
 - Existing carbon capture methods are often costly and centralized, limiting accessibility.
 - This project bridges cutting-edge research with practical engineering design to advance this promising technology.
