# Green Tech for All: Affordable Algae Bioreactors Tackling CO₂ & Clean Water in Low-Income Zones
*Bridging Science and Engineering for a Greener Future*

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

What if we could harness nature’s own engineers — **algae** — to fight climate change and clean water supplies through sustainable design?

This self-directed, 6-week research journey blends **AutoCAD modeling**, **chemical engineering principles**, and **scientific literature** to explore the potential of algae-based photobioreactors for **carbon capture and water purification**.

Rather than building physical hardware, I develop a **digital prototype** inspired by current studies — analyzing and iterating on designs to make these systems more accessible, affordable, and effective.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- **30+ billion tons** of CO₂ enter our atmosphere annually, driving climate change.  
- **Millions** lack access to clean water, threatening health and equity.  
- **Current carbon capture systems** are costly and centralized — often inaccessible in vulnerable regions.

This project merges climate science and engineering design to reimagine carbon capture technology through a lens of **accessibility, affordability, and impact**.

## 🔭 Future Work: Scaling the Vision

This project remains digital and independently led, but the vision continues to grow. With more resources, I am exploring ways to:

- **Prototype Testing**: Build small-scale models to test CO₂ absorption and water purification under real-world conditions.    
- **Species Selection**: Investigate algal strains suited to different climates and pollution types.  
- **Simulation Tools**: Use software like CFD or MATLAB to refine flow, light, and gas transfer designs.  
- **Deployment Potential**: Develop modular or mobile bioreactor units for low-resource areas or urban rooftops.

> *Although currently unfunded, these efforts guide the ongoing mission to make green technology accessible, scalable, and impactful.*
